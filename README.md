# Personal Website

Welcome to my personal [website](https://hecker.vc)! This website is a place where I showcase my projects, share my thoughts, and write about my experiences as an entrepeneur.

If you want to contribute or clone the repository, feel free to do so. The code (mainly the design) is inspired from [Lee](https://twitter.com/leeerob)'s website.
