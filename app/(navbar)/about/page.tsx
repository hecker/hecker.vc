          I started programming when I was 14, running my own Minecraft server
          with a small team, website, web shop, and creative maps. I developed
          all this with help from{" "}
          <Link href="https://github.com/hannibal002">Lorenz</Link>, my first
          mentor, who taught me the basics of Java. That's when I realized{" "}
          <b>
            I loved coding, building things, and creating online communities.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          Around that time, I thought about starting a game server hosting
          business but decided against it since I wasn't 18 yet, and PayPal
          wouldn't allow a business account. My parents wanted me to focus on
          school until I finished my A-Levels, but looking back, I wish I had
          started the business then.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my final year of high school, I launched my first business. It
          all began with a one-week workshop in a big city, where my friends and
          I were trying to find things to do but didn't know anyone. Out of that
          need, I started <b>vamos!</b>â€”a social network for young people to
          connect and see what's going on nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, vamos! got acquired by{" "}
          <Link href="https://jodel.com/de/">Jodel</Link>, a hyperlocal
          community app from Berlin with significantly more users, funding, and
          experience. Now, I focus on product and moderation at Jodel.
